# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture
Participated in the live stream.
Watched the supplementary videos
Created the conceptual and logical diagrams
Mucked around with the AWS account and setup budgets and billing alerts.  This is an account I have had for a few years so some weird stuff may happen. Nice to see AWS have added organisations.
