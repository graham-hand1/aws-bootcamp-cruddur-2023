# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

This week I was ablle to complete all of the bootcamp required tasks and watch the videos.  I was especially interested to see a video posted about how to ask for help which I feel is somethign that many people do not learn.

Required tasks:
* I was able to complete all of the required tasks so I won't list them all here, but I will list the major ones and provide some thoughts......
* Attended the livestream.
* I did remember to commit my code once the livestream had finished. During the week I am doing work with ansible and commiting to GitLab and using Ansible Automation Platform so I feel this has conditioned me to automatically do this.
* I watched and followed along with Chirag's and Ashish's videos on spending and security.  While spend isn't a massive concern for me I'm very much aware that in a professional scenario there are people who will be looking to maximise the cost savings.  Security isn't something I've really had to deal with beyond following best practices for the system I'm building but I've never had to really worry about something that will be exposed to the big bad internet and the legions of hackers out there.
* I have used docker before so I am a quite familiar with the capabilities and how to navigate the container space.
* I enjoyed working through the Open API work, as well as the frontend and backend coding work.

Extras:
* As mentioned, I remembered to commit and push my code after the livestream.  This isn't such a huge deal on my local machine but in Gitpod it could be an issue as I assume all work would be lost if the instance is killed.
* I did notice the notifications page  was still listed as home towards the end of the session so I took the initiative to try and fix that myself before Andrew walked through the process.  Sadly, I wasn't able to fix it as I was only changing one instance of "Home" at a time and then changing it back if my attempt was unsuccessful.
* I did encounter errors with the backend work so I worked through the logs and made the necessary changes to resolve them.
